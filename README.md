Also, read this blog post: [Java Method Logging with AOP and Annotations](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/01/aop-aspectj-java-method-logging.html).

This module contains a collection of useful AOP aspects, which
allow you to modify the behavior of a Java application without
writing a line of code. For example, you may want to retry HTTP
resource downloading in case of failure. You can implement a full
`do/while` cycle yourself, or you can annotate your method with
`@RetryOnFailure` and let one of our AOP aspects do the work for you:

```java
public class MyResource {
  @RetryOnFailure
  public String load(URL url) {
    return url.openConnection().getContent();
  }
}
```

Full list of AOP annotations is [here](http://aspects.jcabi.com/).
